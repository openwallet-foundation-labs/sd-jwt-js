# SD-JWT Implementation in JavaScript (TypeScript)

This is the reference implmentation of [IETF SD-JWT specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/) written in TypeScript. It aims to provide a production-ready, robust and secure way to handle JWTs with selective disclosure capabilities.

Hopae, a founding member of OpenWallet Foundation, is building wallet module in TypeScript and need this project as a core component.

Currently compliant with:

- **[draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-07](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/)**
- **draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc-02**

## **Background**

"Selective Disclosure for JWT" offers a cutting-edge approach to handling JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in a way that enhances user privacy and data security. In today's digital landscape, the demand for efficient yet secure data transmission is paramount. This project addresses that need by enabling selective disclosure of JWT claims, ensuring that only necessary information is shared.

Crucially, the solution is designed to be framework-agnostic, making it compatible with a wide array of JavaScript frameworks, including React and React Native. This broad compatibility ensures that the implementation can be seamlessly integrated into various applications, irrespective of the underlying framework.

Another key aspect of this project is its capability to encode JWTs into QR codes. This feature is particularly useful for mobile and decentralized applications where ease of data transmission is essential. However, the complexity of JWTs can lead to large QR codes that are difficult to scan. Addressing this challenge, "Selective Disclosure for JWT" is specifically optimized to reduce the overall size of the JWT, ensuring that the resulting QR codes are practical and easily scannable.

## **Design Concepts**

The design of "Selective Disclosure for JWT" is centered around flexibility, efficiency, and security. Here are the key design concepts:

1. **Framework Agnostic:** The implementation is designed to be universally compatible with various JavaScript frameworks. It can be easily plugged into applications built with React, React Native, and other frameworks without necessitating significant alterations in the existing codebase.
2. **Data Minimization and Efficiency:** One of the core objectives is to minimize the payload size of JWTs. This is crucial for QR code generation, ensuring that the encoded data is concise enough to be efficiently transformed into a QR code, which remains easily scannable.
3. **Modular Design:** The architecture is modular, allowing developers to integrate selective disclosure capabilities as needed. This modular approach also facilitates easy updates and maintenance.
4. **Security-First:** Security is a paramount concern, especially when handling JWTs. The implementation follows best practices in security and data integrity, ensuring that the selective disclosure process does not compromise the token's security.
5. **Scalability and Performance:** Designed to handle various loads, the implementation remains efficient and performant even under high demand, making it suitable for both small-scale and large-scale applications.

By adhering to these design principles, "Selective Disclosure for JWT" aims to set a new standard in the secure and efficient handling of JWTs across diverse JavaScript environments.
